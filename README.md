# online-job-portal
A modern Online Job Portal built with React.js and styled using Tailwind CSS. It integrates Firebase as the backend to store and fetch job listings. Users can search and filter jobs dynamically based on role, type, location, and experience using an intuitive search bar. Clean UI and responsive design for a smooth user experience.


🔍 Use Case & Functionality:

Users can view latest job listings with details.

A powerful search bar helps filter jobs based on specific preferences.

Great for developers learning to build full-stack apps with React and Firebase.

📸 I'm also adding screenshots of the project to showcase the UI and features.
